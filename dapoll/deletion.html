    <h1>Data Deletion Process</h1>
    <p>At DaPoll, we provide users with the ability to delete their account and all associated data. Below is an
        outline of the process:</p>

    <div class="sections">
        <h3>How to Delete Your Profile:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the DaPoll application.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the <strong>Profile</strong> screen.</li>
            <li>Tap the <strong>Delete Profile</strong> button.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Once you delete your profile, your account and all personal data (email, username, profile photo) will be
            deleted immediately from our servers.</p>

        <h3>Important Note on Polls</h3>
        <p>While your account and personal information will be permanently deleted, any polls where you have previously
            voted will retain your vote count. This ensures the integrity of the polling data, but no personal
            information related to your vote will be accessible or stored.</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you have any questions or issues related to account deletion, please contact us at
        <strong>support@berreix.com</strong>.
