        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Welcome to DaPoll. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and
            protect your personal information when using our app.</p>

        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>

            <li><strong>Profile Photo:</strong> Optional, provided by the user during account setup.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not collect sensitive personal data such as financial or health information.</p>

        <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p>We use the information collected for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Creation:</strong> Your email, username, and profile photo are necessary for setting up
                and maintaining
                your
                account.</li>
            <li><strong>App Functionality:</strong> To ensure a seamless user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Sending OTP Emails:</strong> We use Brevo to send OTP emails during account creation and login.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Sharing with Third Parties</h3>
        <p>We use Brevo to send OTP emails, but we are not certain whether Brevo stores your email address. We recommend
            reviewing Brevo’s privacy policy for more information on their data practices.</p>
        <p>We do not share your data with any other third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>

        <h3>Data Storage and Retention</h3>
        <p>Your data is securely stored on our cloud servers. We retain your data as long as you maintain an account
            with
            us. Once you choose to delete your account, all associated data will be permanently removed from our
            servers.</p>

        <h3>User Rights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Access and Update: You can view your username and profile photo in your account settings. However,
                once
                your username and profile photo are set during account creation, they cannot be changed.</li>
            <li>Data Deletion: You can delete your account and all associated data through the “Delete Profile” option
                available
                in the app’s profile screen.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Security of Your Information</h3>
        <p>We prioritize the security of your data. We use HTTPS to secure communication between our app and servers.
            Please note that while our app is passwordless, we do not currently encrypt user-provided data.</p>

        <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>DaPoll is not intended for users under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal data from
            children. If
            we learn that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take steps to delete it promptly.
        </p>

        <h3>Location Data</h3>
        <p>DaPoll does not collect, track, or store any location data.</p>

            encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
